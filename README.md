   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

### Configuration

- The backend server runs on port 8080
- The frontend development server runs on port 5173

```
GET /chat/music?message={userMessage}
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `message`: The user's query about music (URL encoded)
- **Response**: Streaming text response from the AI

## üîç Implementation Details

### OpenAI Integration

The backend uses Spring AI's OpenAI integration to communicate with OpenAI's API. The system is configured with specific instructions:

1. **System Instruction**: Defines the AI's role as a member of the MusicBot platform team
2. **System Restriction**: Limits responses to music-related topics only
3. **Streaming**: Responses are streamed in real-time to improve user experience

### Response Streaming

The frontend implements a custom streaming solution:
1. Fetches the AI response as a stream
2. Decodes chunks with TextDecoder
3. Progressively updates the UI as new content arrives

### React Component Structure

- **App.tsx**: Main component with routing configuration
- **Home.tsx**: Landing page with welcome message
- **Chat.tsx**: Interactive chat interface with message handling
- **Header.tsx**: Navigation component
